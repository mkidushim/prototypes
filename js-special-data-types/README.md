# Prototypes

## Javascript - Special Data Types 

### Getting Started

1. make an index.html 

2. Create a basic html DOM structure
	- DOCTYPE tag
	- html tag
	- head tag
	- body tag

3. Inside your head tag create a script tag

### Prototype

#### Create three variables

Inside your script tags create the following variables

1. Create a variable `x`, set it to null
2. Create a variable `y`, don't set it to anything
	- Example: `var y;`
3. Create a variable `z`, set it to a string


#### Create some output

Using ONLY the three variables we created above and equal signs create the following output to the console

1. Output 1: `true`
2. Output 2: `false`

Using `typeof` create the following outputs to your console<br>
**NOTE** - Don't just type the strings out, use `typeof`

1. Output 1: `x is an object`
2. Output 2: `y is undefined`
3. Output 3: `z is a string`

#### Additional exercises

After you have successfully created the above outputs, try the following lines in your console on your page:

1. Type: `x` hit enter
2. Type: `y` hit enter
3. Type: `z` hit enter
4. Type: `x == y` hit enter
5. Type: `x === y` hit enter
6. Type: `x == z` hit enter
7. Type: `y == z` hit enter
8. Type: `y == w` hit enter
